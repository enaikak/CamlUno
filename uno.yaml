  CamlUno is a fully functional command-line implementation of the classic UNO card game built entirely in OCaml. 
  The game supports 2-4 players and includes all 108 standard UNO cards with complete functionality for number 
  cards (0-9 in four colors), action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw2), and wild cards (Wild, WildDraw4). Players take 
  turns matching cards by color or value, drawing from a shuffled deck, and using action cards to skip opponents, 
  reverse turn order, or force card draws. The game is played through an interactive terminal interface where players 
  enter commands to play cards from their hand or draw, with the first player to empty their hand declared the winner.
